# you are building for — PyInstaller does not cross-compile.
#
# Why PyInstaller and not Cython: Cython compiles modules to C extensions but
# still needs an interpreter and a launcher around them, so it does not
# produce the single file this is for. Nuitka would, and is the fallback if
# start-up time or source opacity ever matters more than build simplicity.
