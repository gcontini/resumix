"""Reading a job description: detection, then structured analysis.

Two jobs, each on its own model:

- :meth:`JDValidator.detect` — is this text a job posting at all? The free
  structural checks run first (see
  :func:`resumix_contracts.static_jd_guess`); the model (``detect``) is only
  asked when they pass, so a clipboard full of code costs nothing.
- :meth:`JDValidator.analyze` — on the ``analysis`` model, score the posting against the candidate
  profile and extract the facts a CV and a cover letter need.

The profile and the preferences arrive with the call, never from disk: the
same validator instance serves every request.
