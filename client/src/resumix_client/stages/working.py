"""Stages 2 to 4: where a job folder goes next, and every move that puts it there.

:class:`WorkingProcessor` is the only thing that moves a job folder or writes
``approval_status.txt``. The duplicate check, the new folder and every move
happen under one lock, so a posting being filed never races one being
delivered, and the same posting dropped twice is never written twice.

The inbox hands it analysed postings and folders (:meth:`submit`,
:meth:`submit_folder`), ``clipboard`` and ``submit`` the postings they are
about to ask you about (:meth:`hold`), the approval loop your answers
(:meth:`approve`, :meth:`discard`, :meth:`requeue`), and the CV worker
finished and failed jobs (:meth:`deliver`, :meth:`fail`). Anything that has to
wait goes on one of its two queues; where it goes is decided by
:func:`~.jobfolder.route`, for new postings and leftovers alike.
