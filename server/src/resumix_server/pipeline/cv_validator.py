"""Judging the CV: everything wrong with one attempt, in one list.

Two things can be wrong with a tailored CV — it can say something the master
profile does not support, and it can run over the page limit — and they used
to be found in two different places, one round apart. They are found together
here, and come back as one list of violations written in the words the model
is about to be given: the reviewer's own complaints first, what to cut
appended last.

The render is unconditional. A ``pdflatex`` pass costs about a second and a
content review costs the most expensive call in the pipeline, so there is
nothing to save by withholding the page count from a CV the reviewer has
already rejected — and measuring it anyway means a CV that is both overstated
and too long is told about both in one round instead of two.

The review, by contrast, runs until it passes once. After that later rounds
only shorten a CV the reviewer has already accepted, and re-confirming that
would spend that same expensive call to hear the same answer. A review that
gets no usable answer at all leaves the CV unreviewed — not passed.
