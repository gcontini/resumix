"""Finding your files without being told where they are.

The rule is: put your files in the current folder. Anything named below that
sits in the directory you are running from (or in ``--data-dir``) is picked up
by name. An explicit path in ``resumix.toml`` or on the command line always
wins, and what cannot be found locally falls back to the server's default.

Images are the one thing found by shape rather than by name: every ``.png``,
``.jpg`` and ``.jpeg`` in those folders is sent along under its own file name,
because that is the name the LaTeX template includes it under.
