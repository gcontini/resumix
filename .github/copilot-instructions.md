# Copilot Instructions — resumix

**resumix** turns a job description into a tailored, two-page LaTeX CV and
an optional cover letter. It is a `uv` workspace of three packages, split so
each can be deployed and tested independently:

```
contracts/   resumix_contracts  — pydantic models + envelope + the free JD guess
server/      resumix_server     — stateless FastAPI service: LLM calls + pdflatex
client/      resumix_client     — the thing you run: clipboard/watch/submit/render
```

Dependency direction is one-way — `client → contracts ← server`, never
`client ↔ server` — and enforced by `tests/test_architecture.py` (AST-based:
it fails the build if either side imports the other, or if `contracts` pulls
in anything heavier than pydantic). Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first for
the principles this design follows (SOLID, one job per class, no hidden
global state); this file is the file map and the day-to-day commands.

## Components (file map)

**`contracts/src/resumix_contracts/`** — the wire format, nothing else
- `payloads.py` — `CVStatus` (`status`, `detail`: where a CV job is now and
  one line about the step before, no history), `RenderedCV`
  (`tex`, `pdf_base64`, `document`), `CoverLetter`, `ServerStatus`. The CV
  document is a raw flat dict with no schema — what the model wrote with your
  `candidate_data` merged over the top. The schema the CV model writes to is
  *not* here — see `pipeline/cv_schema.py`.
- `jd.py` — `JDAnalysis` (the analysis endpoint's output), `JDDetection`
  (`is_job_description: bool`, nothing else — the reason lives in the log,
  not the reply).
- `envelope.py` — `Envelope[T]` (`request_id`, `ok`, `data`, `error` — every
  endpoint returns this shape, success or failure), `LogEntry`, `RequestLog`.
  No usage/token fields here: each model call logs its own spend as one line.
- `guess.py` — `static_jd_guess(text) -> bool`, the free structural check
  (length band, no binary) both sides can run before paying for anything.

**`server/src/resumix_server/`** — personal data arrives per request and is
dropped when it ends; a request's own directory is the only thing kept
- `api/app.py` — `create_app()`, the ASGI middleware that mints the request id
  (filtered: it names a directory) and sets the log collector contextvar, and
  the startup sweep that fails jobs a dead process left running.
- `api/deps.py` — `AppState`, `envelope_for()`/`envelope_of()`, `claim_slot()`,
  `execute()` (the blocking endpoints: semaphore + threadpool hop + scratch
  dir + the log on disk afterwards).
- `api/jobs.py` — the CV worker thread: re-establishes the `Run`, reports each
  step by rewriting `status.json`, stores the result or the failure.
- `jobstore.py` — one directory per request under `RESUMIX_WORK_DIR`
  (`status.json`, `result.json`, `log.json`, `work/`), atomic writes, pruned
  to the newest 200.
- `api/routers/{health,jd,cv,letter,logs}.py` — one router per resource.
  `logs.py` is `GET /logs/{request_id}` against `jobstore.py`'s directory
  per request under `RESUMIX_WORK_DIR` (newest 200 kept) — the one piece of
  state the server holds, and it is disposable.
- `api/errors.py` — maps `PipelineError`/`ValidationError`/`openai.APIError`
  to a status and an `ok:false` envelope; never echoes the provider body.
- `pipeline/cv_generator.py` — `CVGenerator`: write → review → render →
  condense-to-two-pages (up to `max_attempts` rounds) → keyword highlight →
  render for good. Returns `(document, tex, pdf, summary)`. Pure library code
  — inputs in memory, outputs returned, nothing read from a configured path;
  progress leaves through an injected `progress(status, detail)` callback, not
  a file.
- `pipeline/cv_renderer.py` — `CVRenderer`: Jinja (`\VAR{}`/`\BLOCK{}`
  delimiters, `DictLoader` built fresh per request since the template can be
  client-supplied) → `pdflatex`, sandboxed (`-no-shell-escape`,
  `openin_any=p`/`openout_any=p`, no stdin, a timeout, its own scratch
  `mkdtemp` removed in a `finally`) → page count.
- `pipeline/jd_validator.py`, `pipeline/letter_generator.py` — the other two
  LLM pipelines; same shape as `cv_generator.py`.
- `pipeline/cv_schema.py` — `TailoredCVData`, the CV model's output schema and
  the response model of `POST /v1/cv`. Every `Field(description=...)` is
  restated in a prompt — editing one changes model behaviour. `extra="allow"`,
  so an undeclared field survives validation and reaches the template;
  `prompt_schema()` is the closed variant that goes into the request, because
  strict `json_schema` endpoints refuse `additionalProperties: true`.
- `model_selector.py` — `ModelSelector`, one OpenAI-compatible endpoint per
  role (`summary`/`cv`/`highlight`) from `resources/models.toml`. Every LLM
  call ends with one `logger.info` line carrying model, duration and token
  counts — this is the entire token-accounting story; there is no per-request
  total anywhere.
- `bundle.py` — `ResourceBundle` (impersonal: prompts, template, image assets
  keyed by file name — built once at startup, `with_overrides()` per request) vs.
  `CandidateInputs` (personal: profile and preferences — always per-request,
  never cached, never written to disk). No candidate data: no endpoint takes
  it, because no model reads it.
- `observability.py` — `Run`/`NullRun`, `current_run` contextvar, `stage()`
  context manager, the logging handler that turns log records into
  `LogEntry`s for the run.

**`server/resources/`** — the impersonal defaults baked into the image: four
prompts, `resume.tex.jinja`, `models.toml`, a blank `candidate_signature.png`
(the one image the stock template includes; a request's own images are merged
over the defaults by file name).
Packaged as `resumix_server.resources` (see `server/pyproject.toml`) so
`importlib.resources` still finds it despite living outside `src/`.

**`client/src/resumix_client/`** — your data, a bearer token, no Python
required to run it (PyInstaller `--onefile`)
- `api.py` — `ResumixApi` (Protocol) / `HttpApi` (httpx) — the only module
  that knows the server exists. `ResumixError` carries `request_id` so a
  caller can fetch what the server did.
- `config.py` / `discovery.py` — settings resolution, highest precedence
  first: CLI flag → env var → `resumix.toml` → file found next to the
  executable → server default. `CONFIG_KEYS` maps short TOML keys to the
  filenames `discovery.py` looks for.
- `runner.py` — `JobRunner`: the one place the step order is written
  (detect → analyze → confirm → cv → render → letter → deliver). Every API
  call goes through `_call()`, which fetches the request's server log when
  `--debug` is set, or unconditionally on failure.
- `joblog.py` — `JobLog` (per-job `log.log`, client steps + folded-in server
  log), `format_entries()` (same rendering, for `resumix logs <id>`).
- `workspace.py` — `Workspace`: owns the `working/error/discarded/cv` folder
  tree, atomic moves, the daily subfolders. `take_in(path, move=...)` — moved
  for a watched inbox, copied for a named argument (`submit` must not consume
  the file you pointed it at).
- `sources/{clipboard,folder,single}.py` — the only difference between the
  four modes; each yields `JDCandidate`s to the same `JobRunner`.
- `modes/{clipboard,watch,submit,render,logs}.py` — thin: build a source,
  hand it to `Session`/`JobRunner`, or (for `render`/`logs`) call the API
  directly. `modes/__init__.py`'s `Session` is the shared wiring.
- `tracking.py` — `XlsxTracker` (openpyxl, `applications.xlsx`) / `NullTracker`.
- `ui.py` — `Confirmer` protocol (`PromptConfirmer` / `AutoConfirmer` for
  `--yes`), the analysis table, the recovery prompt.

**Shared**
- `examples/candidate/` — a fictional profile/data/preferences/image set,
  shipped so a fresh download has something to run against immediately.
- `tests/test_architecture.py` — the one-way dependency rule, enforced.
- `tests/test_integration.py` — client and server together in one process
  (httpx against the real ASGI app via `starlette.testclient.TestClient`,
  only the model call faked) — the one test that catches the two sides
  disagreeing about the wire format.

## Key contracts & invariants

- **Every response is the same envelope**, success or failure:
  `{request_id, ok, data, error}`, where `error` is one string. Nothing else
  rides on it — no logs, no usage — so the common case pays nothing for what
  it does not ask for.
- **`GET /logs/{request_id}`** is the only way to see what a request did.
  Backed by that request's directory under `RESUMIX_WORK_DIR`
  (`jobstore.py`, newest 200 kept); an id that was pruned, that failed before
  any work started, or that landed on a different instance, is a `404`. The
  client fetches it after every call with `--debug`, and always on failure.
- **Token spend is per model call, not per request.** `model_selector.py`
  logs one line per call (model, duration, prompt/completion tokens); there
  is no aggregate anywhere in the envelope or the contracts.
- **The CV document is one flat dict with no schema** — whatever your LaTeX
  template reads, put it in `candidate_data.json` and it flows through
  untouched. It is `{**what the model wrote, **your candidate_data}`, so your
  own data wins a collision and the model can never replace a real contact
  detail. The client stores it and posts it back to `/v1/cv/render` without
  parsing a field of it.
- **`POST /v1/cv` is accept-then-poll and takes `candidate_data`.** It answers
  `202` with a job id; `GET /v1/cv/{id}/status` gives `{status, detail}` (the
  current step only, no history) and `GET /v1/cv/{id}` gives
  `{document, tex, pdf_base64}` once it says `END`. The job runs in a detached
  thread that reports by rewriting `status.json`. `candidate_data` is there
  because the loop compiles the CV to count its pages — no model is shown it.
- **The LaTeX subprocess is always sandboxed**: shell escape off
  (`-no-shell-escape`, `shell_escape=f`), reads/writes confined to the
  per-request scratch dir (`openin_any=p`/`openout_any=p`), no stdin, a
  timeout. A client can supply the template *and* a whole `.tex` — treat both
  as hostile input. On a compile failure the TeX log tail goes to the
  server's own log, not into the error body (it is kilobytes; ask for it via
  `/logs` if you need it).
- **`submit` copies its input; `watch` moves it.** An inbox gets emptied; an
  argument you named does not disappear.
- **Concurrency**: one `BoundedSemaphore(RESUMIX_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS)`
  (default 10) gates job handlers → `429` + `Retry-After` when full. No
  second gate for the LaTeX compile — it is fast enough not to need one.
- **Every model reply is re-validated.** The schema is shown in the prompt
  *and* requested via `response_format`, and the reply is parsed by pydantic;
  a `ValidationError` is fed back to the model rather than trusted.

## Conventions

- Python 3.12, `uv` workspace (`pyproject.toml` at the root plus one per
  package); `uv sync` installs all three in editable mode. Console scripts:
  `resumix-api` (server), `resumix` (client).
- LLM access via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — one provider, one API key
  (`MODEL_API_KEY`/`MODEL_BASE_URL`; see `.env.example`), declared once in
  the `[provider]` table of
  `server/resources/models.toml`. The three roles
  (`summary`/`cv`/`highlight`) each declare only model name and generation
  settings, which can also be overridden per role via
  `RESUMIX_<ROLE>_<FIELD>` env vars (model/temperature/thinking/
  structured_output).
- `%`-style lazy logging args, never f-strings inside `logger.*` — sanitized
  LaTeX can reach a log line and a literal `%` would break the formatter.
- LaTeX templates use Jinja delimiters `\VAR{}`/`\BLOCK{}`; escaping is done
  by `_sanitize_latex`/`_sanitize_obj` in `cv_renderer.py` — keep `{}` guard
  groups intact.
- Console prints in the client use `flush=True` (long-lived watch/clipboard
  processes).
- Docker: **classic builder only** — no BuildKit features, no heredocs in a
  Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`, at the repo root, built with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`).
- PyInstaller (`client/packaging/resumix.spec`), not Cython — Cython still
  needs an interpreter and does not produce a standalone exe. Build on the
  target OS; it does not cross-compile.
- Keep the code simple; this is a personal tool wearing production-shaped
  seams (SOLID, tests, sandboxing) because it is a portfolio piece — do not
  add speculative options beyond what is asked.

## Commands

```bash
# setup (once, after cloning or when deps change)
uv sync

# run from source
uv run resumix-api                       # the server
uv run resumix clipboard --out ~/applications   # the client

# tests — all four suites, no API key, no network
uv run pytest
uv run pytest server/tests                 # one package only
uv run pytest -k architecture              # the dependency-direction rule

# the server image (classic builder only)
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build -t resumix-server .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env resumix-server

# the client executable (build on the OS you are targeting)
uv run --with pyinstaller pyinstaller client/packaging/resumix.spec
```

`pdflatex`-dependent tests skip themselves when it is not on `PATH`.
`server/tests/server_helpers.py` wires a real `ModelSelector` to a fake HTTP
client, so request assembly and structured-output negotiation stay under
test with no network call.

## Testing guidance

- No test may need an API key, a network socket, or a terminal.
- Fake at the transport boundary, not above it — inside `ModelSelector` for
  the server, behind the `ResumixApi` protocol (`FakeApi`) for the client —
  so the code that assembles a request is what actually runs under test.
- `server/tests/golden/cv_golden.tex` pins the whole render byte-for-byte; an
  escaping regression is otherwise invisible until someone reads a bad PDF.
- `tests/test_integration.py` is the one place both packages run together;
  keep it passing before touching either side's contract usage.

## Interaction with the user

- The user is skilled: be concise.
- If a design decision was not addressed or clarified in the prompt and
  implementing it one way forecloses another, stop and ask.

## Code style

- Clean up local variables that are only assigned or incremented with no
  effect on the logic.
- Keep decisions as simple as possible — this is not over-engineered
  production code; it borrows production patterns (typed contracts,
  sandboxing, tests) only where the split into a server/client actually
  requires them.
- If a decision introduces a lot of complexity for a small improvement, stop
  and ask before implementing it.
- Prefer clear contracts with mandatory parameters over defaults scattered
  across a method signature.
- Never commit or push — `git commit`/`git push` are strictly forbidden; the
  user reviews and commits every change.
