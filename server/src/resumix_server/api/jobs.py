"""Running a CV job after its request has already been answered.

``POST /v1/cv`` accepts and returns; the writing happens in a thread of its
own, which reports where it is by rewriting ``status.json``. That is the whole
mechanism: a poll reads a file, so nothing has to be held open for the minutes
a CV takes, and a client that stops polling costs nothing.

A plain thread, not the request's: the job has to outlive the response, and
the shared threadpool is where uploads are read, so a job parked there would
block them. The bound on live jobs stays the one semaphore — claimed on the
event loop before the thread starts, released by the thread when it ends.
