# Alibaba Cloud deployment

The server as a Function Compute 3.0 function, and the Container Registry
Personal Edition repository its image is pushed to.

| Managed here | Console only — no API reaches it |
|---|---|
| namespace and repository | the Personal Edition instance (`crpi-…`) |
| function, alias, HTTP trigger, reserved concurrency | the registry login password |
| | rotating the trigger token |

## Run it

```bash
export ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=...
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then fill it in
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

The first plan adopts the resources made by hand in the console
(`imports.tf`): **6 to import, 1 to change**. The change only records which
environment variables are secret; the values are unchanged and nothing is sent
to the function. After that, a plan says *No changes* until a new image is
pushed.

## Deploy

A deploy is an image built from one commit and tagged with its short hash.
Commit first — the tag names the commit, so `git status --short` must print
nothing. Then, from the repository root:

```bash
tag=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
image=$(terraform -chdir=server/terraform output -raw push_repository):$tag
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build -t "$image" .
docker push "$image"
```

Then `terraform apply`. It deploys the newest image in the repository tagged
with a commit hash — so every apply does, including one run only to change an
environment variable — and the plan shows the function's image moving to it.

To run an older build instead, `terraform apply -var image_tag=<its hash>`.
The next apply without it goes back to the newest.

Before the first push, `docker login` to the registry once, with the command
the console's *Access Credentials* page shows.

Why not `latest`: Function Compute resolves the tag to a digest when the
function is updated, and on Personal Edition every invocation fails once the
tag points somewhere else. A tag that moves on every build takes the function
down on every build. A digest (`@sha256:…`) in place of the tag is rejected.

## What to know

- **`terraform.tfvars` and the state hold the provider keys and the trigger
  token in clear text.** Both are gitignored; treat them like `.env`. The import
  plan prints the trigger token once, because the provider does not mark that
  field sensitive.
- **The trigger token is set once, when the trigger is created.** FC stamps
  every token with an id and timestamps, so Terraform ignores the trigger's
  configuration after that. Rotate the token in the console.
- **Renaming the function replaces it**, and the trigger URL — the clients'
  `server_url` — changes with it.
- **From scratch**, in an account with none of this: create the Personal
  Edition instance and its password in the console, delete `imports.tf`, run
  `terraform apply -target=alicloud_cr_repo.main`, push an image as in
  *Deploy*, then run `terraform apply`.
