"""Stage 1: whatever lands in ``--in``, checked, analysed and handed over.

Nothing is claimed up front any more. A posting stays where you dropped it
until its analysis has been handed to the
:class:`~.working.WorkingProcessor`, and only then is it deleted — so a crash
in between costs one more analysis at the next start, never the posting.

- a ``.txt`` file is a posting: the free check, the server's check, the
  analysis, then it is handed over;
- any other file goes to ``error/`` without a call;
- a folder must hold ``jd.txt`` and a valid ``analysis.json`` (an earlier
  job, one from ``error/`` to retry): it is handed over whole, or goes to
  ``error/`` with why.
