"""The terminal, shared by three threads.

The inbox, the CV writer and the question you are answering all print, so
every line from the first two goes through one :class:`Console`: one lock, so
two lines never interleave mid-line, and a hold, so nothing scrolls the
posting you are reading off the screen. Lines that arrive while you are being
asked are printed right after your answer.

Your keyboard is read on a thread of its own (:class:`Keyboard`) because ``q``
has to work when nothing is waiting for you — and then there is no
``input()`` running to type it into.
