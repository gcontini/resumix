"""What the CV model is asked to write — a schema that is also a prompt.

Every ``Field(description=...)`` below is restated to the model inside three
prompts (generation, review, highlighting) via :func:`prompt_schema`, so
editing one of them changes what the model produces. Treat these classes as
prompts, not just as types.

They live here rather than in ``resumix_contracts`` because no client reads
them: ``POST /v1/cv`` hands its caller the JSON the model wrote, and the
caller stores it and posts it back to be rendered without looking inside. The
shape is this server's business — which is also why it is open: a reply with
a field beyond the ones declared here is kept, not dropped, so a request that
brings its own prompt and its own template can put something new on the page
without the schema in the middle having to learn about it first.
