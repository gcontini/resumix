# Model configurations

A running ledger of which provider, model and role combinations have been
tried, and what happened. [`models.toml`](build-server.md#the-provider) says what is
shipped; this page says what is *known to work*, and why the rest does not.

Update it whenever a role changes model or provider, or a provider surprises
you. An entry is only **works** if a real run finished and its output was used.
A failure is recorded with its cause when the cause is known, and with the
exact error name when it is not.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **works** | A real run finished and its output was used |
| **fails** | It was tried and failed; the cause is in the notes |
| **unconfirmed** | Configured, but no run has been recorded yet |

## Providers

What each endpoint is known to accept. This is the part that carries over to
the next model you try.

### Alibaba Model Studio (DashScope): Qwen and hosted DeepSeek

Endpoint: `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`, or the
workspace endpoint of the same form shown in the console.

- **works:** Chat Completions honours `thinking_budget` exactly. Probed on
  `qwen3.8-max-0902` on 2026-09-28: a budget of 500 gave 500 reasoning tokens,
  2000 gave 2000, both `finish_reason=stop`.
- **works:** the switches are `extra_body` fields: `enable_thinking`,
  `thinking_budget` and `enable_search`.
- **works:** DeepSeek V4 models served through DashScope do run web search
  (2026-09-27).
- **fails:** the Responses API. It ignored token limits (8242 reasoning tokens
  against a budget of 6500) and heavy calls stalled past 600 s. resumix stays
  on Chat Completions.
- Some models cap `max_tokens` at 8192; set it per model when the endpoint
  says so.

### DeepSeek (native)

Endpoint: `https://api.deepseek.com`.

- Model ids: `deepseek-flash` (V4.1-Flash, current) and `deepseek-v4-pro`.
  `deepseek-v4-flash` is still accepted but is a retired name served by
  V4.1-Flash ([pricing page](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing),
  checked 2026-10-08).
- **fails:** web search. The endpoint accepts a `web_search` tool and runs no
  search; its docs list every built-in tool as ignored (2026-09-27). Search
  needs DashScope-hosted DeepSeek instead.
- In thinking mode DeepSeek ignores `temperature`, so the review role's
  `temperature = 0` has no effect there (per DeepSeek's docs; not yet observed
  here).

### OpenAI

Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

- `gpt-6-luna` is a valid API id (released 2026-09-22) and takes
  `reasoning_effort` from `none` to `max`
  ([OpenRouter listing](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-6-luna)).
- **fails (reported, not yet observed here):** `temperature` other than 1 while
  reasoning is on. GPT-5.6-family models answer 400 `Unsupported value:
  'temperature' does not support 0.4 with this model`
  ([OpenAI forum](https://community.openai.com/t/temperature-in-gpt-5-models/1337133/26));
  LiteLLM's [Luna notes](https://docs.litellm.ai/blog/gpt_6_sol_luna) say the
  same for Luna. Fix: `RESUMIX_<ROLE>_TEMPERATURE=1`, or empty to send none.
- **fails (expected, not yet observed here):** `enable_search`. It is a
  DashScope parameter, and the summary role adds it to the cover-letter request
  whenever the posting names a company. Fix: `RESUMIX_SUMMARY_WEB_SEARCH=false`.
- Do not leave `thinking = "on"` on an OpenAI role: it sends `enable_thinking`,
  which OpenAI does not take. Use `RESUMIX_<ROLE>_THINKING=auto`.
- Chat Completions function calling needs `reasoning_effort = "none"`. resumix
  sends no tools, so this does not apply.

## Roles

One row per configuration tried, newest first within a role. *Provider* is the
endpoint the call went to: `use_alternate_provider` empty means the
`[provider]` default.

### summary (JD analysis and cover letter)

| Provider | Model | Settings | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI (`use_alternate_provider = 3`) | `gpt-6-luna` | `reasoning_effort = xhigh`, `thinking = auto`, `temperature = 1`, `web_search = false`, `json_object` | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Set after the two failures below. |
| OpenAI, misrouted | `gpt-6-luna` | `use_alternate_provider = 1`, `thinking = on`, `temperature = 0.4`, `web_search = true` | **fails** | 2026-10-08 | `1` means the default provider, so the call went to the DashScope endpoint with the DashScope key. Then 400 `BadRequestError` once routed; the request carried the temperature and thinking switch OpenAI does not take. The error text itself was not read. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-flash` (shipped) | `thinking = on`, `reasoning_effort = max`, `temperature = 0.4`, `web_search = true` | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Current `models.toml`. |
| DashScope | `deepseek-v4.1-flash` | `reasoning_effort = max`, `temperature = 0.4`, `json_object` | **fails** | 2026-10-06 | Both attempts replied with a search-call shape (`{'query': …, 'top_k': 5}`) instead of the analysis: 12 `JDAnalysis` validation errors. |
| DashScope | `deepseek-v4.1-flash` | `reasoning_effort = high`, `temperature = 0.4` | **fails** | 2026-10-06 | `AuthenticationError` on two postings. Cause not recorded. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.7-flash-2026-07-15` | `reasoning_effort = high`, `temperature = 0.4` | **fails** | 2026-09-30 | `PermissionDeniedError` on all 64 requests. Cause not recorded. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.7-flash-2026-07-15` | `reasoning_effort = low`, `temperature = 0.4` | **fails** | 2026-09-29 | Finished (`stop`) but the reply failed `JDAnalysis` validation, twice. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.7-flash-2026-07-15` | `reasoning_effort = low`, `temperature = 0.1` | **fails** | 2026-09-28 | `APIConnectionError` on four requests. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-flash` | `reasoning_effort = low`, `temperature = 0.1`, `max_tokens = 3000` or unset | **fails** | 2026-09-28 | Finished (`stop`) but the reply failed `JDAnalysis` validation, twice, on four postings. The analysis schema and prompt were reworked afterwards ("solve errors in analysis", 2026-10-06). |

### cv (CV writing)

| Provider | Model | Settings | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-max-0902` (shipped) | `json_schema_strict`, `thinking = on`, `thinking_budget = 7500`, `max_tokens = 17000` | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Current `models.toml`. The budget behaviour is confirmed under *Providers*. CVs were produced on 2026-10-06, but the client logs do not record the model id; `resumix logs <request id>` does. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-max` | `json_schema_strict`, `thinking_budget = 6000`, `max_tokens = 16000`, `temperature = 0.9` | **works** | 2026-09-23 | Generate finished in 133 s with 5610 reasoning tokens, under the budget. The review pass on the same model finished in 42 s. |

### review (CV against the master profile)

| Provider | Model | Settings | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek (`use_alternate_provider = 2`) | `deepseek-flash` | `reasoning_effort = high`, no `thinking_budget`, `temperature = 0`, plain text | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Thinking mode makes DeepSeek ignore the temperature (see *Providers*). |
| DashScope | `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` (shipped) | `thinking_budget = 9000`, `max_tokens = 15000`, `temperature = 0`, plain text | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Current `models.toml`. The review loop ran on 2026-10-06 (violations listed, CV regenerated); the model id is in the server log. |

### detect (is it a job posting?)

| Provider | Model | Settings | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek (`use_alternate_provider = 2`) | `deepseek-flash` | `temperature = 0`, `max_tokens = 1000`, `thinking = off`, plain text | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | `thinking = off` sends `enable_thinking: false`, which DeepSeek's native API does not document. |
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-flash` (shipped) | same settings | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Current `models.toml`. |

### highlight (the `**bold**` pass)

| Provider | Model | Settings | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DashScope | `qwen3.8-flash` (shipped) | `thinking = off`, `temperature = 0.1`, `json_object` | **unconfirmed** | 2026-10-08 | Current `models.toml`. |

## Recording a result

Add a row under the role, with the provider, the exact model id, the settings
that differ from `models.toml` (including any `RESUMIX_<ROLE>_*` override), the
date and the outcome. For a failure, the error name from the job log
(`provider_error: … PermissionDeniedError`) or the server log
(`resumix logs <request id>`) belongs in the notes; the cause belongs there
once it is known. Never record keys, workspace URLs or request payloads.
