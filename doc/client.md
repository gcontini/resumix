# The client

One executable, seven modes. It keeps your CV data on your machine and sends it,
per request, to a server that holds the model API keys and the LaTeX
toolchain. No Python, no API key and no LaTeX install of your own.

```text
resumix [global options] MODE [mode options]
```

Global options work on either side of the mode name: `resumix -v submit
posting.txt --out ~/applications` and `resumix submit -v …` do the same
thing.

## Which mode

```mermaid

## The modes

### `clipboard` — copy a posting, get a CV

```bash
resumix clipboard --out ~/applications
```

Watches the clipboard. When you copy something that looks like a posting, it
checks with the server, analyses it, prints the analysis and asks — every
posting, whatever its `should_apply` says:

```text
Paste the posting URL to submit, y = submit without link, n/s = skip, q = quit
> https://jobs.example.com/12345
```

- `y`, or the posting URL: its CV is queued and the clipboard is watched
  again at once. CVs are written in the background, one at a time, while you
  read the next posting; their lines are tagged with the job's folder name
  (`[Acme_Corp_Head_of_IT] …`) and held back while a question is on screen.
  The URL is stored in `analysis.json` and goes to the spreadsheet.
- `n` or `s`: it is filed under `discarded/`.
- `q`: clipboard mode stops. The posting stays in `working/`, marked
  `PENDING` in its `approval_status.txt`, and is asked about again at the
  next start — never decided by its `should_apply`.

**Stopping.** `q` also works while nothing is being asked: the CV being
written is finished, and the approved ones still queued wait in `working/`
for the next start. Ctrl-C stops at once.

**Startup.** Anything left in `working/` by a previous run is offered back to
you first: *resume*, *clean* or *quit*. Resume sends each folder where its own
files say — the table under `watch`'s *Startup*: approved ones go straight to
the CV writer, and the ones still waiting for an answer are asked about
before anything new is read.

With `--yes` nothing is asked: every posting is submitted, and so is every
leftover waiting for an answer.

On Linux the clipboard needs a helper — `apt install xclip` (X11) or
`wl-clipboard` (Wayland) — and a reachable `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. The
client probes it at startup and tells you if it cannot read it, instead of
waiting forever for a change that can never arrive. Over SSH, forward X11 or
use `watch`, which needs no clipboard at all.

### `watch` — drop files into a folder

```bash
resumix watch --in ~/Downloads/postings --out ~/applications
```

Each posting goes through four stages, and the analysis decides the route:
`should_apply` YES gets its CV without a question, CHECK waits for you, NO is
put aside. The CVs are written in the background, one at a time, while you
read the next posting.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    IN["<b>1 · analysis</b><br/>--in"] -->|"YES"| GEN["<b>3 · waiting for the CV</b><br/>working/"]
    IN -->|"CHECK"| ASK["<b>2 · waiting for you</b><br/>working/"]
    IN -->|"NO"| DISC["discarded/"]
    IN -->|"not a posting,<br/>or a call failed"| ERR["error/"]
    ASK -->|"y"| GEN
    ASK -->|"d"| DISC
    ASK -->|"s / n: later"| ASK
    GEN -->|"written"| CV["cv/"]
    GEN -->|"a call failed"| ERR
```

What you can drop:

- **A `.txt` file** — the posting, read as UTF-8 text. It has to look like a
  posting (the local check, then the server's), otherwise it lands in
  `error/` with a `.log` beside it. Once its analysis is filed, the file is
  deleted from `--in`. Any other file — a PDF, a `.docx` — goes to `error/`
  with nothing sent: paste its text into a `.txt`.
- **A folder** holding `jd.txt` and a valid `analysis.json` — one from `cv/`,
  `discarded/` or `error/`, for instance. Detection and analysis are skipped:
  it is copied into `working/` under its company and title, removed from
  `--in`, and goes where its own files say (the table under *Startup*). One
  that also holds its CV (`cv_<name>_<job_title>.json` or a `.tex`) is re-rendered — one
  LaTeX compile, no model call, no new spreadsheet row. A folder with no
  `jd.txt`, or whose `analysis.json` does not validate, goes to `error/` with
  a `log.log` inside saying why.

Names starting with `.` are ignored, and anything still being copied in is
left alone until it stops changing.

**When a posting needs you** (CHECK), you see its text, then the analysis,
and answer:

```text
y = write the CV (or paste the posting URL), d = discard, s/n = next, q = quit
> https://jobs.example.com/12345
```

- `y`, or the posting URL: its CV is queued. The URL is stored in
  `analysis.json` and goes to the spreadsheet.
- `d`: it is filed under `discarded/`.
- `s` or `n`: it is asked again after the others.

Your answer is kept in the folder as `approval_status.txt` — `APPROVED` or
`DISCARDED` (`clipboard` and `submit` also write `PENDING` while they wait for
yours). Anything typed before a posting was on screen is thrown away, so
a stray `y` never approves one you have not read, and what the inbox and the
CV writer print is held back until you have answered.

**Stopping.** `q` works at any time, also when nothing is waiting for you:
nothing new is started, the posting being analysed and the CV being written
are finished, then the watcher exits. Ctrl-C stops at once; the next start
picks up whatever was running, and a posting still in `--in` is read again.

**`--yes`** asks nothing: YES postings get their CV, NO postings are
discarded, and CHECK postings wait in `working/` for a run without `--yes`.

**Startup.** Whatever an earlier run left in `working/` goes where its own
files say, before anything new is read. The rules are tried in this order:

| The folder holds | It goes to |
|---|---|
| no `jd.txt`, or no valid `analysis.json` | `error/` |
| its CV: `cv_<name>_<job_title>.json` or a `.tex` | re-rendered, then `cv/` |
| no `approval_status.txt` | by `should_apply`: YES to the CV queue, CHECK to you, NO to `discarded/` |
| `approval_status.txt` saying `APPROVED` | the CV queue |
| `approval_status.txt` saying `DISCARDED` | `discarded/` |
| `approval_status.txt` saying `PENDING` | you: asked about again, whatever `should_apply` says |
| `approval_status.txt` saying anything else | `error/` |

A folder dropped into `--in` follows the same table. To retry a job that
failed, move its folder from `error/` back into `--in`; to have a CHECK
posting written without being asked, set its `approval_status.txt` to
`APPROVED` first. A loose file left in `working/` by an older version goes to
`error/`: move it back into `--in` to have it read again.

`--in` defaults to `./incoming`, created if missing. It may not be the same
folder as `--out`, and the watcher has to be allowed to delete from it.

### `submit` — one file, once

```bash
resumix submit posting.txt --out ~/applications --yes
```

The same steps as `clipboard`, for a single file: analysed, asked about
(unless `--yes`), and the CV written right there — the command returns once
it is filed. No recovery prompt: a one-off run must not start by asking about
someone else's leftovers. The file you name is **read**, never moved — unlike
`watch`, which empties the folder it watches. `q` at the question leaves the
posting in `working/` as `PENDING`, to be asked about at the next start of
`clipboard` or `watch`.

```bash
resumix submit posting.txt analysis.json --out ~/applications
```

With an `analysis.json` for the posting — from an earlier run's folder, say —
detection and analysis are skipped and it goes straight to the CV; you are
still asked first, unless `--yes`. Both are copied into the job folder as
`jd.txt` and `analysis.json`, so the analysis you passed is the one delivered
beside the CV. One that does not validate stops the command before anything is
sent or written.

### `submit-raw` — just the CV, right here

```bash
resumix submit-raw posting.txt
resumix submit-raw posting.txt -o cv.pdf -o cv.json -o cv.tex
```

The CV and nothing else: no detection, no analysis, no question before
spending, no cover letter, no spreadsheet, no folders. Files land in the
directory you are standing in.

`-o` is repeatable and the suffix is the whole instruction — `.pdf` writes the
PDF, `.json` the document, `.tex` the LaTeX. A name you chose is overwritten
without asking, because a name you chose is a name you meant. With no `-o` you
get one PDF named after the posting (`posting.txt` → `posting.pdf`), and a
second run counts up to `posting_1.pdf` rather than replacing it.

### `render` — compile an edited CV

```bash
resumix render ~/applications/cv/26-01-15/Acme_Head_of_IT/cv_jordan_rivera_head_of_it.json
resumix render cv_jordan_rivera_head_of_it.tex --output /tmp/preview.pdf
```

Give it the `.json` document to re-render from the content, or the `.tex` to
compile a hand-edit. The PDF lands next to the input unless `--output` says
otherwise. Needs no profile and no posting — just the server — and costs one
LaTeX compile and no model call. A failed render prints the server's log for
that request, which is where the LaTeX error is.

### `logs` — what the server did

```bash
resumix logs b510f8dff047
```

Every failure names a request id; this is the other half of that. It prints
that request's server-side log — each model call with its duration and token
counts, and the error that ended it. The server keeps the last couple of
hundred requests, so ask reasonably soon; a pruned id gives `404`.

### `version` — which build is this

```bash
resumix version
```

Prints `version x.y.z` and exits. It reads no configuration and talks to no
server, so it answers even when `resumix.toml` is wrong. Every `--verbose` run
prints the same line at startup, which is what you want in a bug report.

The number comes from the package metadata bundled into the executable, so it
is the version the release workflow built — there is no string in the source to
forget to bump.

## Postings you have seen before

Before anything is spent on a posting, every `analysis.json` under `cv/`,
`discarded/` and `working/` is read back. A posting is the same job when its URL matches, or
when its company *and* title match — case, accents and spacing ignored. A side
without a URL is compared by company and title only; one without a company or
title, by URL only. Old files are read as they are, never validated: one that
cannot be read is skipped.

The check runs as soon as a posting is analysed, before you are asked, in
every mode. A posting already applied to, discarded or still in flight prints
`already applied`, `already discarded` or `already in progress` with the
earlier folder, and is dropped: nothing is asked and nothing is written. The
mode carries on: the clipboard keeps waiting, `submit` exits. In `watch`, a
posting with a `JOB_POSTING: <url>` line is checked by that URL before
anything is sent, LinkedIn ids included: one already known is deleted from the
inbox with the same message, and costs no call at all.

A posting that is dropped leaves nothing behind: the earlier copy already
holds it. So to redo one, *move* the earlier folder out of `cv/` or
`discarded/` first — before you copy the posting again, and instead of
copying a folder you drop back into `watch`.

## Options

### Global

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--server URL` | The resumix server. Default `http://localhost:8080`. |
| `--token TOKEN` | Bearer token, if the server requires one. |
| `--temperature F` | Sampling temperature for the CV and the cover letter, passed to the server. The analysis, the review and the highlight pass keep the server's. |
| `--pages N` | Page limit the CV must fit. Default: the server's, which is 2. |
| `--config FILE` | Use this `resumix.toml` instead of searching for one. |
| `--data-dir DIR` | Look for your files here before the current folder. |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Fetch the server's log after **every** call and fold it into `log.log`. Without it, only failures are fetched. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Print `version x.y.z` at startup, then what the server reports about each finished step — tokens, thinking tokens, elapsed, and the reviewer's or the page check's own words — plus the request id and the `/healthz` attempts. |

### Per mode

| Flag | Modes | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--out DIR` | clipboard, watch, submit | The output folder (`working/`, `error/`, `discarded/`, `cv/`). Default: the current folder. |
| `--in DIR` | watch | The folder to watch. Default: `./incoming`, created if missing. |
| `--cover-letter no\|yes\|letter_only` | clipboard, watch, submit | Also write a cover letter, or write *only* one. Default `no`. |
| `--yes` | clipboard, watch, submit | Submit every valid posting without asking. Unattended runs spend tokens on their own. A posting already applied to, discarded or in flight is skipped, still without asking. In `watch` it only stops the questions: YES postings get their CV, NO postings are discarded, CHECK postings wait in `working/` for a run without `--yes`. |
| `--no-xlsx` | clipboard, watch, submit | Do not record delivered CVs in the spreadsheet. |
| `--resume REQUEST_ID` | submit, submit-raw | Pick up a CV job already running on the server instead of submitting a new one: start from its `/status`. For a job whose answer never came back. |
| `-o FILE` | submit-raw | Write one output here: `.pdf`, `.json` or `.tex`. Repeatable. |
| `--output FILE` | render | Where to write the PDF. Default: beside the input. |

Exit code is `0` when nothing failed, `1` when a posting failed or the client
could not start (a missing file, an unreachable server, a bad config).

## Configuration

Everything resolves in this order:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CLI["command line"] --> ENV["environment"] --> TOML["resumix.toml"] --> FOUND["a file in the<br/>current folder"] --> SRV["the server's default"]
```

### `resumix.toml`

Looked for as `--config`, then `$RESUMIX_CONFIG`, then `resumix.toml` in
the current folder.

```toml
server_url   = "https://resumix.example.run.app"
token        = "the-bearer-token"   # only if the server requires one
cover_letter = "no"                 # no | yes | letter_only
# temperature = 0.4                 # CV and cover letter, passed to the server
# pages       = 2                   # page limit the CV must fit
# timeout     = 1800                # seconds to keep polling one CV job
# debug       = true                # same as -d on every run
# verbose     = true                # same as -v on every run

[files]                             # explicit paths win over discovery
# profile        = "~/cv/candidate_profile.json"
# candidate_data = "~/cv/candidate_data.json"
# preferences    = "~/cv/candidate_preferences.md"
# template       = "~/cv/resume.tex.jinja"
# prompt_cv      = "~/cv/sys_prompt_cv.txt"
# prompt_highlight = "~/cv/sys_prompt_highlight.txt"
# prompt_review    = "~/cv/sys_prompt_review.txt"
# prompt_letter    = "~/cv/sys_prompt_letter.txt"
```

A relative path under `[files]` is resolved against the config file's own
folder, and a path that does not exist is an error rather than a silent
fallback. The keys are short on purpose: TOML reads
`candidate_profile.json = "x"` as a dotted key, which is not what anyone
means.

### Environment

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RESUMIX_API_URL` | The server URL. Beaten by `--server`. |
| `RESUMIX_API_TOKEN` | The bearer token. Beaten by `--token`. |
| `RESUMIX_CONFIG` | Path to `resumix.toml`. Beaten by `--config`. |

### Your files

Put them in the folder you run from (or in `--data-dir`) and they are picked
up by name:

| File | What it is | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `candidate_profile.json` | Everything you have ever done. The model tailors the CV from this — the more complete, the better. | **yes** |
| `candidate_data.json` | Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, languages, location, education. Printed by the template as-is; no model is shown it. | **yes** |
| `candidate_preferences.md` | What you want from a job, in prose. Scored against each posting. | for analysis |
| `resume.tex.jinja` | Your own LaTeX template. | no — the server's is used |
| `sys_prompt_cv.txt`, `sys_prompt_highlight.txt`, `sys_prompt_review.txt`, `sys_prompt_letter.txt` | Your own prompts. | no — same |

Every `.png`, `.jpg` and `.jpeg` in those folders is sent too, under its own
file name — and that name is the whole contract: the server writes each one
next to the `.tex`, so `\includegraphics{photo.jpg}` in your template is
satisfied by a `photo.jpg` sitting next to you. At most 10 per request.
`candidate_signature.png` is just one such image: the stock template includes
it, and the server has a blank one if you do not.

Start from the fictional set in the repository's `examples/candidate/`.

## What you get

```text

└── applications.xlsx                    one row per delivered CV
```

File names come from your own `candidate_data.json`, not from the server.

To revise a CV: edit `cv_jordan_rivera_head_of_it.json` and run `resumix render` on it —
one LaTeX compile, no model calls. Editing the `.tex` and rendering that works
too. The spreadsheet's own header row is the schema: rename, reorder or add
columns in your copy and the rows follow.

`log.log` holds the client's steps, and the server's account of each request
on failure (or on every call with `--debug`):

```text
2026-01-15T09:30:12 ✍ writing the CV (this takes minutes)...
--- server request b510f8dff047 ---
  2026-01-15T09:30:53 INFO    [cv.generate]   [cv] qwen-max 41.2s | prompt=7104, completion=1832, thinking=903
  2026-01-15T09:31:03 INFO    [cv.review]     [cv] qwen-max 9.8s | prompt=5210, completion=96
```

One line per model call is what it cost.

## What leaves your machine

Per request: the posting text, your `candidate_profile.json`, your
`candidate_preferences.md` (for the analysis), your `candidate_data.json` and
every image in the folder. Whether *the model provider* keeps what it is shown
is between you and whoever runs the server — the same question as with any
hosted model.

**No model is ever shown your `candidate_data.json`.** It is sent because the
server compiles the CV to count its pages, and a page count taken with the
contact block missing is not the page count of the CV you will send; it goes
to the LaTeX template and nowhere else.

Nothing at all is sent for text that fails the local length and binary checks,
so a copied password or a screenful of code never leaves the machine. The
server holds a finished CV in a directory of its own until a couple of hundred
newer requests have pushed it out, and keeps nothing else.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| `cannot reach the resumix server at …` | The server is down or the URL is wrong. `curl <url>/healthz` to check. |
| `did not come up after 3 attempts` | The server was unreachable on three tries two seconds apart — a cold container may need longer; try again. |
| `401` / `a valid bearer token is required` | The server wants a token: set `token` in `resumix.toml` or pass `--token`. |
| `candidate_profile.json is required but was not found` | Put it in the current folder, or name it under `[files]`. |
| `no clipboard here: neither DISPLAY nor WAYLAND_DISPLAY…` | Install `xclip` or `wl-clipboard`, or use `watch`. |
| `429` / `all job slots are busy` | The server is at capacity. Try again shortly. |
| `[clipboard] ✗ not a job description (412 chars, nothing sent)` | What you copied is a fragment. Nothing was sent anywhere. |
| A posting you wanted lands in `error/` | Read the `.log` beside it. A wrong "not a job description" verdict usually means the copy grabbed only part of the page. |
| A folder you dropped lands in `error/` | It needs `jd.txt` and a valid `analysis.json`. The `log.log` inside it says which was missing. |
| You need more than the error line | Re-run with `-d`, or `resumix logs <request id>` while the server still has it. |
| `working/` is not empty | A previous run stopped mid-job, a CV was still queued when you pressed `q`, or a posting waits for your answer (CHECK, or `PENDING`). `watch` picks everything up by itself at startup (see its *Startup* table); `clipboard` offers to resume or clean. |
| The client died but the job was running | `resumix submit posting.txt --resume <request_id>` picks it back up. |
