"""``resumix submit`` — one file, one CV, then exit.

The same steps as ``clipboard`` — analysed, asked about, written — but the CV
is written right here, and the command returns once it is filed. Whatever an
earlier run left in ``working/`` is not touched: a one-off run must not start
by asking about it.
