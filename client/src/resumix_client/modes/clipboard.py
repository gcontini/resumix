"""``resumix clipboard`` — watch the clipboard; each CV is written while you read the next posting.

What an earlier run left in ``working/`` is dealt with first, as you choose:
resumed (approved postings go to the CV writer, unanswered ones are asked
about before anything new), cleaned out, or left alone by quitting. Then the
clipboard is read on the main thread (:mod:`resumix_client.stages.listener`)
and the CVs are written on a thread of their own.
