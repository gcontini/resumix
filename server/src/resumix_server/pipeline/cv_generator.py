"""Writing the CV: job description in, :class:`TailoredCVData` out.

The loop is generate -> review -> render -> measure -> condense, and the
render in the middle is the point: the two-page limit is checked against a
real compiled PDF, so the instruction fed back to the model ("remove 1
duty") is grounded in what actually overflowed rather than a guess. The PDF
produced along the way is thrown out with the scratch directory; the caller
merges in its own candidate data and renders the result when it wants the
file.

The page checks render your ``candidate_data`` too. They have to: a page
count taken with the contact details missing is not the page count of the CV
you will send. No model is shown that data — it goes to the template and
nowhere else — but the renderer needs it, and so the endpoint takes it.

Every input arrives in memory — prompts and template in a
:class:`~resumix_server.bundle.ResourceBundle`, the profile and the
candidate data in :class:`~resumix_server.bundle.CandidateInputs`. Nothing
is read from disk and nothing is written outside ``work_dir``.
