"""A job folder on disk, and the stage it belongs in.

Every folder the watcher handles — one it has just analysed, one dropped into
the inbox, one an earlier run left in ``working/`` — goes where its own files
say. That rule is :func:`route`, and it is pure: what the folder holds in,
where it goes out. :func:`classify` only reads the folder for it.

The one file this package adds to a job folder is ``approval_status.txt``: what
you decided about a posting that needed you — or ``PENDING``, for one that
``clipboard`` or ``submit`` is asking you about and nobody has answered yet.
Everything else — ``jd.txt``, ``analysis.json``, the CV files, ``log.log`` —
is what the rest of the client already writes.
