"""Writing the CV: job description in, :class:`TailoredCVData` out.

The loop is generate -> validate -> regenerate: every round writes a CV,
:class:`~resumix_server.pipeline.cv_validator.CVValidator` says what is wrong
with it, and what it says becomes the next round's task. The render inside
that check is the point: the two-page limit is measured on a real compiled
PDF, so the instruction fed back to the model ("remove 1 duty") is grounded in
what actually overflowed rather than a guess. The PDFs produced along the way
are thrown out with the scratch directory; after the last round the keywords
are highlighted and the result is rendered once more, for good.

The page checks render your ``candidate_data`` too. They have to: a page
count taken with the contact details missing is not the page count of the CV
you will send. No model is shown that data — it goes to the template and
nowhere else — but the renderer needs it, and so the endpoint takes it.

Every input arrives in memory — prompts and template in a
:class:`~resumix_server.bundle.ResourceBundle`, the profile and the
candidate data in :class:`~resumix_server.bundle.CandidateInputs`. Nothing
is read from disk and nothing is written outside ``work_dir``.

        The selector. Its ``cv`` role writes the CV, ``review`` judges each
        one against the master profile, and ``highlight`` adds the
        ``**bold**``/``*italics*`` markers to the finished content. Built once
        by the caller and shared across requests — it holds HTTP clients, not
        per-job state.
    highlight:
        ``False`` skips the highlight pass.
    bundle:
        Prompts and the LaTeX template for this run (defaults, or whatever the
        request overrode).
    candidate:
        The profile the model tailors from. Not cached; it dies with the
        request.
    work_dir:
        Scratch directory for the page-check renders. Created and removed by
        the caller.
    max_attempts:

    deadline:

        that cannot finish in time fails with a clear cause instead of being
        cut off by a proxy.
