"""What the CV model is asked to write — a schema that is also a prompt.

Every ``Field(description=...)`` below reaches the model — in the request's
strict JSON schema, or in the format instructions of a ``json_mode`` prompt —
so editing one of them changes what the model produces. Treat these classes as
prompts, not just as types.

They live here rather than in ``resumix_contracts`` because no client reads
them: ``POST /v1/cv`` hands its caller the JSON the model wrote, and the
caller stores it and posts it back to be rendered without looking inside. The
shape is this server's business — which is also why it is open: a reply with
a field beyond the ones declared here is kept, not dropped, so a request that
brings its own prompt and its own template can put something new on the page
without the schema in the middle having to learn about it first.

Accepting an unexpected field and inviting one are different things, though:
the schema the model is *shown* is closed (:data:`CLOSED`), because a strict
``json_schema`` endpoint refuses ``additionalProperties: true`` outright.
